            If an interface has no direct superinterfaces, then the interface implicitly declares a public abstract
            member method m with signature s, return type r, and throws clause t corresponding to each public instance
            method m with signature s, return type r, and throws clause t declared in Object, unless a method with the
            same signature, same return type, and a compatible throws clause is explicitly declared by the interface.
